People were trying to get their features completed and all the test cases passing. At the same time, classmates were in and out trying their best to point others in the right direction if they were stuck. It was a sweet memory to remember that everyone was on the same boat -- feeling stressed but determined to finish their work before a big deadline.

In ECE344, doing exam preparation on a google document. People were leaving answers and comments on this large master sheet of answers that was curated by students. We were all working collaboratively and helping each other out to get the right answer.","Not taking courses out of my zone of familiarity and planning far ahead. There are some courses from other faculties which I think I could have taken, if I had done more research in advance.","Breathe. Ask for help. Don't give up because you are so close to being done. Make an effort to have long-lasting friendships. Work is temporary. Your job is temporary. Friendships in undergrad will help you through the tough times and help you appreciate the good ones too. Lastly, try your best to plan ahead and think ahead. Better to do things early than late. :)",
